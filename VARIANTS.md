# KNIFE FIGHT VARIANTS

The rules that we put in place are very basic. They are the rules that we personally recommend, but there are a few things you can change from our rules to better suit your needs and desires.

## ONES WE'VE THOUGHT OF

### VARYING HAND SIZE

You don't have to hold just 3 cards in your hand, you can hold more or less, if you want. We recommend 3 in order to make a game with a single deck of cards last longer, but hands of 4 and 5 are just as fun.

### MULTIPLE CARD DECKS

You don't have to play with just one deck, you can use as many decks as you like. Just make sure they can be divided evenly between players.

## VARIANTS YOU CAN WORK ON

### MULTIPLE PLAYERS

We haven't messed around with the number of players in the game. Typically, you'd have a knife fight one-on-one, but if you can think of a way to knife fight two people or more, go right for it. You'll probably need more than one deck of playing cards, of course.
