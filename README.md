# Knife Fight: The Card Game
### The thrill you've always been too afraid to experience yourself
Have you ever challenged somebody to a knife fight, one-on-one? Yes? Well, how did that go for you? Not well, probably. Of course, you seem to have made it out alive, but what does that really mean? You could've bled to death, unless you're just *that good*, and now you've probably got scars. Kinda sucks, if you're an average guy.

If you said no, but you've always dreamed of cutting your enemies apart with a combat knife, you've come to the right place. Now, with this game, **you can figuratively dice your enemies by challenging them to a duel using nothing but a single, regular deck of cards.** A single game shouldn't take you any more than 10  minutes top, and you can feel the joy of your friends or nemeses bleeding to death with no real threat of personal injury or lawsuit.

## Setup

As I said earlier, all you need is **a single deck of 56 cards, jokers included.** But you're going to need to do a bit of setup, first.

1. Split the deck into two halves, black and red.
    + *Suits are ignored in this game, so don't worry about them.*
2. Shuffle both halves separately, and give one to either player.
3. Both players draw 3 cards from the top of their deck. These are your hands.
4. Place the decks off to the side, where there is enough room for adjacent discard piles.

It's that simple to set up. Of course, it wouldn't be a game without rules of some form.
