# Knife Fight: The Card Game
### The thrill you've always been too afraid to experience yourself
Have you ever challenged somebody to a knife fight, one-on-one? Yes? Well, how did that go for you? Not well, probably. Of course, you seem to have made it out alive, but what does that really mean? You could've bled to death, unless you're just *that good*, and now you've probably got scars. Kinda sucks, if you're an average guy.

If you said no, but you've always dreamed of cutting your enemies apart with a combat knife, you've come to the right place. Now, with this game, **you can figuratively dice your enemies by challenging them to a duel using nothing but a single, regular deck of cards.** A single game shouldn't take you any more than 10 minutes top, and you can feel the joy of your friends or nemeses bleeding to death with no real threat of personal injury or lawsuit.

## Setup

As I said earlier, all you need is **a single deck of 54 cards, jokers included.** But you're going to need to do a bit of setup, first.

1.  Split the deck into two halves, black and red.
    +   *Suits are ignored in this game, so don't worry about them.*
2.  Shuffle both halves separately, and give one to either player.
3.  Both players draw 3 cards from the top of their deck. These are your hands.
4.  Place the decks off to the side, where there is enough room for adjacent discard piles.

It's that simple to set up. Of course, it wouldn't be a game without rules of some form.

## Rules

### Turn Progression

Knife Fight is played in a series of rounds, during which players;

1.  Play cards and compare their effects
    +   The person with the **lower** numerical card beats the other player.
    +   The Joker and face cards have special abilities. We'll talk about them in the next section.
2.  Apply damage cards to their corresponding damage piles
    +   The player that has the card with the lower value than the other player's card puts their card in their opponent's damage pile.
3.  Draw cards from their decks to regain their hands of 3
    +   **IMPORTANT**: Always remember to replenish your hand BEFORE you bleed. It can be easy to forget.
4.  "Bleed" by discarding cards from their decks based on the sum of their individual damage piles
    +   Both players find the sum of the cards in their damage piles, divide that value by 3, then round up. The resulting integer is the number of cards that the players remove from their deck.

This cycle repeats until one or both of the players no longer have cards in their deck. That point is when a player bleeds to death.

If anything up to this point seems confusing, it's okay, we'll have a detailed game example later on.
