#  Example

Let's say that [Leon][1] and [Krauser][2] are having a standard knife fight. They divide the deck in half, and set up the game.

### Before the game

|       Info       | [Leon][1] | [Krauser][2] |
|:-----------------|:----:|:----:|
| Cards in Deck    |  24  |  24  |
| Cards in Discard |   0  |   0  |
| Cards in Damage  |   0  |   0  |
| Sum of Damage    |   0  |   0  |
| Bleed Amount     |   0  |   0  |

In the first round, [Krauser][2] plays an Ace, and [Leon][1] plays a 6. This means that *[Krauser][2]* won the round, and [Leon][1] adds the ace to his damage pile. Both players draw to complete their hands, and [Leon][1] moves one card from his deck to the discard, because of his bleed value.

### After Round 1

|       Info       | [Leon][1] | [Krauser][2] |
|:-----------------|:----:|:----:|
| Cards in Deck    |  22  |  23  |
| Cards in Discard |   2  |   0  |
| Cards in Damage  |   1  |   0  |
| Sum of Damage    |   1  |   0  |
| Bleed Amount     |   1  |   0  |

In the second round, [Krauser][2] plays a 6, while [Leon][1] plays a jack. Since jack is a parry, both cards are discarded, and neither player wins this round. They draw, and [Leon][1] bleeds.

### After Round 2

|       Info       | [Leon][1] | [Krauser][2] |
|:-----------------|:----:|:----:|
| Cards in Deck    |  20  |  22  |
| Cards in Discard |   4  |   1  |
| Cards in Damage  |   1  |   0  |
| Sum of Damage    |   1  |   0  |
| Bleed Amount     |   1  |   0  |

In the third round, [Krauser][2] plays king, while [Leon][1] plays an 8. They both reveal thir cards, and [Krauser][2] can play a second card because of his feint; an Ace. Since an Ace is lower than 8, [Krauser][2] wins another round. Both players draw, although *[Krauser][2] draws 2 cards* to regain his hand of 3, and [Leon][1] bleeds.

### After Round 3

|       Info       | [Leon][1]   | [Krauser][2] |
|:-----------------|:------:|:----:|
| Cards in Deck    |  18    |  20  |
| Cards in Discard |   6    |   2  |
| Cards in Damage  |   1 1  |   0  |
| Sum of Damage    |   2    |   0  |
| Bleed Amount     |   1    |   0  |

In the fourth round, [Krauser][2] plays a 9, and [Leon][1] an 8. [Leon][1] narrowly wins, and [Krauser][2] puts the 8 in his damage pile. Both players draw, but now both bleed.

### After Round 4

|       Info       | [Leon][1]   | [Krauser][2] |

| Cards in Deck    |  16    |  16  |
| Cards in Discard |   7    |   3  |
| Cards in Damage  |   1 1  |   8  |
| Sum of Damage    |   2    |   8  |
| Bleed Amount     |   1    |   3  |

In the fifth round, [Krauser][2] plays a Queen, while [Leon][1] plays an Ace. This is a very good move for [Krauser][2], as he now switches out the 8 in his damage pile for [Leon][1]'s ace. The 8 is discarded, both players draw and bleed.

After Round 5

|       Info       | [Leon][1]   | [Krauser][2] |
|:-----------------|:------:|:----:|
| Cards in Deck    |  14    |  14  |

| Cards in Damage  |   1 1  |   1  |
| Sum of Damage    |   2    |   1  |
| Bleed Amount     |   1    |   1  |

In the sixth round, [Krauser][2] plays a 3, and [Leon][1] plays an Ace. [Leon][1] wins this round, and the regular cycle repeats.

### After Round 6

|       Info       | [Leon][1]   | [Krauser][2]   |
|:-----------------|:------:|:------:|

| Sum of Damage    |   2    |   2    |
| Bleed Amount     |   1    |   1    |

In the seventh round, [Krauser][2] plays a 4, while [Leon][1] plays his Joker. With that, [Krauser][2]'s 4 is reflected back at him, building his damage pile. The cycle repeats.

### After Round 7

|       Info       | [Leon][1]   | [Krauser][2]   |
|:-----------------|:------:|:------:|
| Cards in Deck    |  10    |  10    |

| Cards in Damage  |   1 1  |   1 1 4  |
| Sum of Damage    |   2    |   6    |
| Bleed Amount     |   1    |   2    |

### After Round 8

In the eighth round, [Krauser][2] plays another Queen, trying to heal himself again. However, [Leon][1] plays a 10, and [Krauser][2] switches it with his 4. Once again, the game cycles.

|       Info       | [Leon][1]   | [Krauser][2]   |
|:-----------------|:------:|:------:|
| Cards in Deck    |  8    |  4    |

| Cards in Damage  |   1 1  |   1 1 10  |
| Sum of Damage    |   2    |   12    |
| Bleed Amount     |   1    |   4    |

The game is coming down to the wire. In the ninth round, [Krauser][2] plays his Joker, trying to deal fatal damage to [Leon][1]. Unfortunately, [Leon][1] played a jack, nullifying the Joker's effect.

### After Round 9

|       Info       | [Leon][1]   | [Krauser][2]   |
|:-----------------|:------:|:------:|
| Cards in Deck    |  6    |  0    |
| Cards in Discard |  17    |   17    |
| Cards in Damage  |   1 1  |   1 1 10  |
| Sum of Damage    |   2    |   12    |
| Bleed Amount     |   1    |   4    |

[Krauser][2] has run out of cards in his deck. This means that [Leon][1] wins, since he is still standing. Of course, he'll bleed out in a little while, but the person who dies the least wins.
